        <b>
        <h3>Do you count punctuation or only words?</h3></b>
        <p>I only count words. This decision was made because it would yield the fastest results for us to truly differentiate language.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Which words should matter in similarity comparison?</h3>
        <p>This application removes common stop words, so that only the differences can be analyzed. </p>
         <br>
        <h3>Do you care about word ordering?</h3>
         <p>My application does not care about the ordering of words. </p>
          <br>
        <h3>What metric will you use to assign numerical value to similarity?</h3>
         <p>
            The metric used for text similarity is the equation: 
            # of unique matches / total unique words in both samples
        </p>
         <br>
        <h3>What are the data structures and algorithms you used to complete the task?</h3>
        <p>Dictionaries, lists, and sets were employed. The sets were used for comparing unique words between two samples and are helpful because they execute better than lists. </p>
